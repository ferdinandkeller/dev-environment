# Development Environment

This project contains a single Dockerfile.

Its purpose is to quickly open a fully-featured development environment for any kind of project, on any machine that has Docker installed.

This environment will evolve as my knownledge of Neovim, Tmux, and other tools grows.

> note : The code here is really ugly !! That's because I'm still learning how to use LUA, Neovim and Tmux.
